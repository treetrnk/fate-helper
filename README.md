# FATE HELPER

This is a web application using AngularJS to be used with FATE, the roleplaying game by Evil Hat. The intention is for it to be used by the Game Master as an organization tool. This can help you keep track of all of the small bits of information present in the game at any given time, and it allows quick editting.
