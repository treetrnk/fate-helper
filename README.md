# FATE HELPER

This is a web application using AngularJS to be used with the Fate Core and Fate Accelerated (FAE) roleplaying games, by [Evil Hat](http://evilhat.com). The intention is for it to be used by the Game Master as an organization tool. This can help you keep track of all of the small bits of information present in the game at any given time, and it allows quick editting. Think of it as an alternative to a GM screen.
